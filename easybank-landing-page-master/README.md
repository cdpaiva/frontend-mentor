# Easybank landing page

Live version:

This is a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

This is a landing page for a ficcional digital bank.
The project was created with SASS and vanilla JS.
There are some nice features on this page, such as the usage of multiple background images to compose the initial view, and the responsive layout.

There is a single breakpoint at 375px, creating one mobile version and one desktop version.
JS was only used to create the hamburger menu effect, which consist of simply changing classes for a few elements of the page.
