## Description

This is a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
The goal is to clone a landing page.
This is a pure HTML and CSS project, including the user notifications for input validation, which for me was the most interesting part of this project.

The layout is mobile responsive, with a single breakpoint at 375px.
The page was constructed using a mobile first approach, which overall felt much straightforward to develop than starting with the desktop layout and then fit in the content in smaller screens.
